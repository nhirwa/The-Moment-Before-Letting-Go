# The-Moment-Before-Letting-Go
A projectection-0based immersive art piece designer to invoke an emotion of dissociation. The act of living in the present and feeling calm to your world slowly leaving till the feeling of nothingness. 

## Artist's Statement 
The initial spherical form functions as a representation of the self. I made the object 3D to give it a sense of weight and presence. As it dissolves, it symbolizes the mind slowly trying to protect you by releasing heavy emotions. However, that release does not return you to something new. Instead, it creates an empty, almost distant space â€” a sense of nothingness.
